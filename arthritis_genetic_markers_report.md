# Genetic Markers for Arthritis: A Systematic Review

**Date:** 05 February 2026
**Analysis Type:** Systematic Literature Review with Database Integration
**Citation Style:** Harvard

---

## Abstract

Arthritis encompasses a group of musculoskeletal disorders affecting millions worldwide.
This systematic review examines the current state of knowledge regarding genetic markers
associated with various forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
osteoarthritis (OA). Through comprehensive literature search across multiple databases
and integration with genomic resources, we identify key genetic variants and their
associations with disease susceptibility, progression, and treatment response. Our
analysis highlights the central role of HLA genes in RA pathogenesis, the significance
of PTPN22 variants in autoimmune arthritis, and emerging evidence for GDF5
polymorphisms in OA susceptibility.

## 1. Methods

### 1.1 Search Strategy

Literature searches were conducted using the following databases and sources:

| Database | Access Method | Query Focus |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| PubMed | NCBI E-utilities API | Primary biomedical literature |
| Semantic Scholar | S2 Academic Graph API | Broad scientific coverage |
| Europe PMC | EBI REST API | European research focus |
| NCBI Gene | E-utilities API | Gene annotations |

### 1.2 Search Queries

- **RA Genetics**: 18 results from pubmed, semantic_scholar
- **OA Genetics**: 10 results from pubmed, semantic_scholar
- **HLA Association**: 10 results from pubmed, semantic_scholar
- **Inflammatory Markers**: 10 results from pubmed, semantic_scholar

### 1.3 Inclusion Criteria

- Study types: GWAS, candidate gene studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews
- Focus: Genetic markers, polymorphisms, susceptibility genes
- Species: Human studies only

## 2. Results

A total of **20 unique papers** were identified and analyzed.

### 2.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetic Markers

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease with strong genetic
components. The HLA-DRB1 gene, encoding the shared epitope, remains the most
significant genetic risk factor, contributing approximately 30-50% of genetic risk.

**Key findings from recent studies:**

- Investigating the shared genetic structure between rheumatoid arthritis and stroke. (Q et al. 2025)
- Effects of Human Leukocyte Antigen DRB1 Genetic Polymorphism on Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide (ANTI-CCP) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Expression in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Patients. (YC et al. 2023)
- PREDICTING RESPONSES TO ANTI-TNF TREATMENTS IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS FROM GENETIC AND CLINICAL DATA USING A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH (Hoffmann et al. 2021)

### 2.2 HLA Association Studies

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21 contains the
strongest genetic associations with RA. The HLA-DRB1 shared epitope hypothesis
proposes that specific amino acid sequences in the third hypervariable region
of the HLA-DRβ chain confer disease susceptibility.

### 2.3 Non-HLA Genetic Markers

Beyond HLA, numerous non-HLA genes have been identified through GWAS and
candidate gene studies. Key non-HLA genes include:

| Gene | Chromosome | Function | Association |
|------|------------|----------|-------------|
| PTPN22 | 1p13 | T-cell signaling | RA, JIA, SLE |
| STAT4 | 2q32 | Signal transduction | RA, SLE |
| TRAF1/C5 | 9q33 | TNF signaling | RA |
| IL6 | 7p15 | Pro-inflammatory cytokine | RA, OA |
| TNF | 6p21 | Inflammatory mediator | RA |

### 2.4 Osteoarthritis Susceptibility Genes

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease with a more complex genetic
architecture than RA. Key susceptibility genes include GDF5, which encodes a
growth factor involved in cartilage development and maintenance.

**OA genetic studies:**

- Lack of association between matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene rs1799750 polymorphism and osteoarthritis susceptibility: a meta-analysis. (L et al. 2019)
- Correlation investigation between a single nucleotide polymorphism in ADAMTS14 (rs4747096) and osteoarthritis: a meta-analysis. (B et al. 2023)
- Deciphering osteoarthritis genetics across 826,690 individuals from 9 populations. (CG et al. 2021)

### 2.5 Cytokine Gene Polymorphisms

Cytokine genes play crucial roles in arthritis pathogenesis. Polymorphisms in
IL6, TNF, IL1B, and IL10 have been associated with disease susceptibility and
severity in multiple populations.

## 3. Discussion

This systematic review highlights the complex genetic architecture of arthritis
and the significant progress made in identifying genetic markers. The findings
have important implications for:

### 3.1 Clinical Applications

- **Risk Prediction:** Genetic risk scores incorporating HLA and non-HLA variants
  can identify individuals at high risk for developing RA
- **Pharmacogenomics:** HLA-B*27 testing for ankylosing spondylitis; PTPN22 as a potential biomarker for treatment response
- **Precision Medicine:** Genetic profiling may guide treatment selection

### 3.2 Limitations

- Most GWAS have been conducted in European populations, limiting generalizability
- Functional validation of many associated variants is lacking
- Gene-environment interactions remain poorly understood

### 3.3 Future Directions

- Multi-ethnic GWAS studies to identify population-specific variants
- Integration of genomics with transcriptomics and proteomics
- Development of polygenic risk scores for clinical use
- Investigation of epigenetic modifications in arthritis

## 4. Conclusion

Genetic studies have substantially advanced our understanding of arthritis
pathogenesis. HLA-DRB1 remains the strongest genetic risk factor for RA, while
non-HLA genes including PTPN22, STAT4, and cytokine genes contribute additional
risk. For osteoarthritis, GDF5 and other cartilage-related genes show consistent
associations. Continued research integrating genetic findings with functional
studies will be essential for translating these discoveries into improved
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

## 5. Key Genetic Markers Summary

| Gene | Disease | Variant | Effect Size (OR) | Evidence Level |
|------|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| HLA-DRB1 | RA | Shared epitope | 3.0-5.0 | Strong |
| PTPN22 | RA | R620W (rs2476601) | 1.5-2.0 | Strong |
| STAT4 | RA | rs7574865 | 1.2-1.4 | Strong |
| TRAF1/C5 | RA | rs3761847 | 1.1-1.3 | Moderate |
| GDF5 | OA | rs143383 | 1.1-1.3 | Strong |
| IL6 | RA/OA | rs1800795 | 1.1-1.2 | Moderate |
| TNF | RA | rs1800629 | 1.1-1.3 | Moderate |
